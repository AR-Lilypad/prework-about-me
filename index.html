      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently an administrative coordinator for a local hospital emergency department.  I have maintained the department's intranet website for clinicians for sometime using the WYSIWYG Dreamweaver. The website grew to include a lot more complex content, so I spent time making it more visually accessible.  While working on cleaner and more attractive styles in the WYSIWYG, I became interested in learning how to work outside of the application's design mode and working with the code. I completed the UARTS web design and development certificate program. After this, I put the department website through a 3rd redesign iteration and while commencing the coding process realized I not only need but desire more skill development... and here I am. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>

      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
