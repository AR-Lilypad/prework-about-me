      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently an administrative coordinator for a local hospital emergency department.  I have maintained the department's intranet website for clinicians for some time using the WYSIWYG Dreamweaver. The website grew to include more and complex content, so I spent time making it more visually appealing and accessible.  While working on cleaner and more attractive styles in the WYSIWYG, I became interested in learning how to work outside of the application's design mode, in code. Enter UARTS web design and development certificate program. Upon completion, I created a 3rd redesign iteration for the department and while working on coding realized I not only need but desire more skill development... and here I am. </p>
